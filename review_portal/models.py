------------------------------ Documentation for the 'Course' class ------------------------------

Member attributes:

-> department (An object of the 'Department' class) - The department which offers this course.

-> code (An integer) - The unique identifier of every course in a department.

-> info (A text field) - A short paragraph describing the course.

-> ratings (A list of floats) - All the ratings that the course has received. 
== Currently, all the ratings are being made by a single user (the superuser).
== Later, if multiple users are implemented, ratings must also record the user who gave each rating.
== When the 'User' class is implemented, there must be a many-to-many relationship between users and courses.

Member functions:

-> average_rating() - returns the average of all the ratings that this course has gotten.

-> rank() - returns the rank of this course (in terms of average rating) in it's department
